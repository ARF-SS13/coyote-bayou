<!-- Repeated three times above so you DEFINITELY KNOW. We need this. [OOC tab -> Show Server Revision], paste the information here with your report. This helps us determine if the issue was caused by a testmerge or live code. VITAL. -->

<!-- **For Admins:** Oddities induced by var-edits and other admin tools are not necessarily bugs. Verify that your issues occur under regular circumstances before reporting them. -->
