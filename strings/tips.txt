Clicking on a windoor rather then bumping into it will keep it open, you can click it again to close it.
You can change the control scheme by pressing tab. One is WASD, the other is the arrow keys. Keep in mind that hotkeys are also changed with this.

If you need to drag multiple people to safety, or a grave bring a locker or crate over and stuff them all in before hauling them off.

Holding alt and left clicking a tile will allow you to see its contents in the top right window pane, which is much faster than right clicking.

You can move an item out of the way by dragging it and then clicking on an adjacent tile with an empty hand.
While both heal toxin damage, the difference between charcoal and antitoxin is that charcoal will actively remove all other reagents from one's body, while antitoxin only removes various toxins - but can overdose.

You run slower with large weapons out. Holster them before making a run for it!
Run out of bullets? Use a knife!
Bleeding can be fatal, so bandage yourself quickly before you lose too much blood. You can craft bandages out of cloth. One way to get cloth is to cut up clothing with a knife.
Dragging bleeding people around is a good way to drain them of their blood. Before moving an injured person, consider stopping the bleeding or carrying them by aggressively grabbing them and dragging them onto your sprite.
To those untrained in the way of traversing rough terrain, sticking to the roads may be a faster means of travel.

Try and develop your character across rounds and get invested in a narrative.
Your life has value. Sometimes it's better to give someone what they want in order to preserve it.
Don't stand in the hole you're filling with sand. If you do, resist to slowly break free. (Takes time and has no feedback.)
Priming a grenade automatically toggles throw mode. If you also toggle throw mode, it will be un-toggled so maybe don't do that.
Putting an * at the end of your message (or a ! at the beginning) will turn it into an emote. You can emote over the radio this way. You can follow the * with more text to also say something.

Before entering irradiated areas (look for green glowing puddles, destroyed old-world cars, etc) you should take some Rad-X pills to protect yourself. Alt-Click the bottle of them that you spawned with to pull one out quickly!
Learning a Martial Art from a scroll will prevent you from using guns, magic, and other ranged weapons.
Be careful when using fragmentation explosives, as the fragments travel very far and can cause a lot of unintentional damage!

Some enemies are much more dangerous than others. Examine them (and then duck back into cover) to get an idea of what they're weak against and how dangerous they are!
If you find the Mysterious Keycard, but don't want to engage in PVP, just leave it where you found it; Carrying it will make you a valid PVP target at all times by anyone seeking the card for themselves. See the rules channel on the Discord server for more information.

Pressing Shift-X will dual-wield the two weapons you're holding or two-hand a single weapon if you other hand is free. Doing either will usually result in you doing more damage per second on average, but at the cost of control and protection. Press it again or drop/equip the item to cancel your grip.
If you're hurt, but not completely unconscious, you can crawl away to someplace safe and then use the Sleep/Sleep-Toggle verbs to heal back up! Sleeping in a bed will heal you faster, too! There's a button to toggle sleeping on your HUD, look for the triple Zs.
