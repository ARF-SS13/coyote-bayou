///QUIRK PACKAGES/// QUACKAGES IF YOU WILL
//Read it all, you're a big peoples, I believe in you.

//The Purpose of these quirks is to be ready made character design concepts, they will include positive and negative quirks packaged together to ease character creation.

//If the Quackage is all positive quirks then you should add the point cost of all the quirks involved and add 20% on top, this will mean that taking it is more expensive
//than to have taken the quirks individually, but it only takes up one good quirk slot.  The 20% number referenced above is really just a starting point, honestly
//follow your fucking heart, you're probably smarter than I am. ~TK420634

//If the quackage includes negative quirks, be sure to make it very clear in the mechanics variable that you have included that negative, do not jump negative quirks on players
//without properly warning them of what exactly they're getting into. Be sure also to make the conflict list include all the quirks that the trait includes, positive and negative.
//That way players don't waste precious character design points on taking quirks they already have in their quackage.

//Be wary of overloading the donkey, there really should be a hard limit to what you're thematically tyring to glue together here. These are supposed to be plug and play
//character archetypes, not entire builds that are ready made. Though, if you're willing to put in the forethought and really plan it out I can't say that there would be a problem
//with maybe making a Class category that is analgous to the Class quirks in the rp category. It would, honestly, simplify character creation some.

//What follows is the code for Former Tribal, commented out, to be used as a reference for creating Quackages that include both quirks and recipes.
