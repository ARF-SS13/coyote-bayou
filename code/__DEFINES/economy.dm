	C:/README.txt<br /> \
	=================<br /> \
	Welcome to the Adventurer's Guild Quest Console, helping connect our \
	shattered world through the power of quests! Now partnered with \
	Gekkertec, we are now able to offer a wider variety of quests on a \
	wider variety of platforms running FoxEye 1.0 or higher.<br /> \
	<br /> \
	This console is your one-stop shop for all things quest-related. You can \
	take on quests, complete them, and earn rewards for your efforts. You can \
	also see how you stack up against your fellow adventurers and earn the \
	title of Top Earner or Top Quester!<br /> \
	<br /> \
	At the top of the console, you'll see your username. Please verify that \
	this is in fact you, and if it's not, please contact your local system \
	administrator. To the right, you'll see the unclaimed balance for your \
	work. If this number is greater than 0, you can tap the button to print \
	out a voucher for your earnings, good for use at any participating \
	Adventurer's Guild location. For a list of participating locations, \
	please consult the Adventurer's Guild website.<br /> \
	<br /> \
	Below your username, you'll see your region's Quest Statistics. The \
	left-hand side of the panel lists information relating to the quests \
	completed in this Adventure Cycle. The top number is the number of quests \
	you've completed, the number in the middle is the highest number of \
	quests completed by any adventurer in this cycle, and the bottom number \
	is the total number of quests completed by all adventurers in this cycle.<br /> \
	<br /> \
	The right-hand side of the panel lists information relating to the \
	rewards earned in this Adventure Cycle. The top number is the total \
	amount of your region's currency you've earned this cycle, the middle \
	number is the highest amount of currency earned by any adventurer in this \
	cycle, and the bottom number is the total amount of currency earned by \
	all adventurers in this cycle.<br /> \
	<br /> \
	Below the Quest Statistics panel, you'll see the Quest Console. This \
	panel is divided into three tabs: Active Quests, Available Quests, and \
	Finished Quests. The Active Quests tab lists all the quests you have \
	currently accepted. The Available Quests tab lists all the quests \
	available to your region. The Finished Quests tab lists all the quests \
	you have completed in this cycle.<br /> \
	<br /> \
	Each quest card in the Active Quests and Available Quests tabs lists, \
	from left to right, the quest's difficulty, name, and reward. The quest's \
	difficulty is a rough indicator of the recommended dedication for this \
	quest, as opposed to the actual skill required to do it, and often \
	comes with a higher reward for higher difficulties. To see more information, \
	and to accept or complete the quest, simply tap the card. If you are \
	unable to accept a quest, it will be greyed out.<br /> \
	<br /> \
	At the bottom of the console, you'll see a timer counting down to the \
	next batch of available quests. If you'd like to be alerted when the \
	quests refresh, you can tap the speaker icon to toggle the alert on or \
	off. To the right, you'll see a button to retrieve a Quest Scanner.<br /> \
	<br /> \
	The Quest Scanner is your key to interacting with your quests. To use \
	it, simply use the scanner on the item, creature, or device you want \
	to submit, and if it corresponds to a quest objective, it will attempt \
	to turn it in. The Quest Scanner also comes with an active Quest \
	Detector, which if you use it in hand, will highlight all quest \
	relevant objects within a 7 meter radius.<br /> \
	<br /> \
	If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please contact your \
	local system administrator. Thank you for using the Adventurer's Guild \
	Quest Console, making whats left of the world a better place, one quest \
	at a time.<br /> \
