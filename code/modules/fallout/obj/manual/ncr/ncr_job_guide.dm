	<h1>Lieutenant</h1>
	<p>You’ve been placed in 2nd in command of the NCRA garrison at Camp Miller. It is your job to make sure that the men make it out the other side at the end of the week, and that the goals of the NCR are advanced.</p>
	<h2>Duties of the Lieutenant</h2>
	<h3>Commanding Officer</h3>
	<p>If the Captain is not present, you’re the be all and end all for the Army at Camp Miller, everyone reports to you. This gives you a great deal of responsibility. Making you responsible for the strategic planning of the Army. It is up to you to decide what the plan is for that week, and execute it. In terms of the Army, you have the final say. You’re also responsible for dealing with people outside the NCR, mostly for negotiations, while you do not have the ability to create official truces or any binding treaties between any other powers, you can create mutual agreements with other powers that last a week maximum. Overall, your job is to focus on the big picture, and what that means for the NCRA located here.</p>
	<h3>Administrative Duties</h3>
	<p>You do have a few administrative duties to take care of as an officer. You’re allowed to promote the men under your command up to the rank of Corporal, as well as recommend High Command to promote people above the rank of Corporal. You can also recommend people for demotion by contacting High Command. You’re also clear to hold military tribunals to find someone guilty of a Major Offense(MO) as outlined in the COMJ. You’re also free to issue any Non-Judicial Punishments(NJPs) as you see fit.</p>
	<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
	<p>As the Lieutenant you coordinate the NCRA at Camp Miller. It is your job to ensure that the Camp runs smoothly. When you first come on duty, announce your presence over the radio and ask for the rest of the garrison to report in as well. Check to see if the Camp has been split into two squads, if they have not, do so. Give these squads taskings, and from there play it by ear.</p>
	<h3>Organizing the Men</h3>
	<p>It is best to split all army personnel on duty into two squads, one “Base” squad and one “Away” squad. Make sure that the NCOs are split evenly between the two squads(One Sergeant and Corporal to a squad). Make sure to only place one Specialist per squad as well-making each one more specialized.</p>
	<h3>Resource Gathering</h3>
	<p>Camp Miller, comes equipped with a bare minimum of resources. It is important at the start of the week to gather enough to last you throughout the week. A few pieces of equipment are very important to the survival of Camp Miller. Here is what the Camp needs, ordered by most pressing to least. Send out either a squad, or ask the Rangers to gather these for you. It is important that this is done early in the week, the longer the round goes on for, the less of a chance there is of you to find these items, if at all.</p>
	<p>1-Guns and Bullet books-Needed to upgrade the reloading bench, part three is very important as it gives us the ability to make more 5.56 ammo.</p>
	<p>2-Advanced Workbench-Needed to make use of blueprints.</p>
	<p>3-Wood/Metal/Glass-Needed by Combat Engineers to expand base defenses, fuel workshops, and make extra equipment for the Camp.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camp Miller has an attached mine, after mining the iron found can be smelted to make metal</p>
	<p>Cars can be welded down to get extra metal</p>
	<p>4-Stimpaks & other medical supplies</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything needed to make stimpaks&nbsp;can be either grown at the farm, or produced through the workshop. Best to assign the base team to this task early in the round. At most the camp will need 30-40 stimpaks. Medics will also need bone gel and surgical tape which can only be found in the wasteland.</p>
	<p>5-General Foodstuffs</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best to grow some razorgrain and other foods, allow someone to act as a cook and let them grow what they need to produce meals, good task to give to someone from the base team or to give to a member of Rear Echelon.</p>
	<h3>The Chain of Command</h3>
	<p>It is important to understand the chain of command, a military lives and dies by how effective they are able to understand and follow through on this simple concept. The chain of command is pretty simple, it is a hierarchy that determines how orders are passed down. What this means for you is that you should be giving your orders to your Sergeant First Class(SFC) and your Sergeants(SGT). What you should not be doing is trying to micromanage everyone in Miller, rather split them up into squads, and delegate tasks and objectives to your SFC and squads.</p>
	<h3>Managing the Men</h3>
	<p>Most of your time throughout the week will be sent coordinating your two squads. It is best to have one “away” squad and one “base” squad, and swap each squad between these two roles as the round goes on.It is best to give each squad a color associated with it as well, and give them colored armbands to wear to make it easy to tell who is who. Make sure that each squad gets an appropriate amount of up and down time. For example, after a squad comes home from a patrol, give them some free time in the canteen, before giving their squad leader another task.</p>
	<h4>Rangers</h4>
	<p>The Rangers exist outside of the NCRA command structure, and for our purposes a separate branch of the NCR’s military. You are allowed and encouraged to work with them, just keep in mind if they have more pressing matters they may choose to disregard your requests. If possible, find ways to try and work with the Rangers, whether that be you supporting them by sending a squad to support whatever they are doing, or them supporting you by sending a group of Rangers to support what the Army is doing.</p>
	<h4>Making use of your SFC</h4>
	<p>You're not the only member of Camp Miller’s command staff. You also have a Sergeant First Class to help you run the infantry. They are best used as a problem solver, and advisor, sending them out to squads that are having trouble completing their objectives, or during a training exercise to lead them-to ensure that everyone, even the Sergeants, learns something new. If you have nothing pressing for the SFC, let them float between squads, giving advice and orders as needed. It is advised that you develop a close relationship with your SFC, as they are the only one that you can trust against the unwashed masses of infantry. &nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Leadership</h2>
	<p>When you’re leading a faction, it is up to you to find something for the faction to do for a round, and to keep the faction’s playerbase engaged. It is a daunting task, and if done poorly, it could ruin other people’s fun. You have to be careful, not to only ensure that your faction has fun, but that your faction is fun to interact with. Written below are four pillars that are good to prescribe to as leadership.</p>
	<p>Active</p>
	<p>Make sure that the people in your faction are actively doing something, make sure that the tasks they are given require them to think, interact with others, or interact with the game. An easy, but simple example of an active activity could be-mopping floors&nbsp;or cleaning the walls with soap, or clearing a dungeon. You could also ask that the men set up a panic bunker inside the mines, or to patrol the area around Camp Miller.</p>
	<p>Immersive</p>
	<p>Ensure that whatever tasks you have given your players, help immerse them further in the world, one example would be ordering the men to clean off their weapons or maintain their guns after a patrol or firefight.</p>
	<p>Meaningful</p>
	<p>Make sure that the context behind what the players are doing-is meaningful. Ensure that the orders given are not arbitrary from a OOC perspective especially. This meaning can be derived from a RP situation or from game mechanics. For example, when clearing a dungeon, there is mechanical reasoning to clear it-for the loot at the end or if holding up a toll road, a RP reasoning-to gather funds for the NCR.</p>
	<p>Fair</p>
	<p>Finally, one of the most important pillars. This is mostly from an OOC standpoint, if your character is an uncompromising hardass, more power to you. However, from an OOC standpoint, be forgiving, if someone goes AFK, don’t punish them ICly for it. As well as be willing&nbsp;to make a few concessions for fun-if someone goes combat engineer and they’ve made it clear they like to do patrols-put them on the patrol team. This also applies to interactions with people outside your faction as well, try to do what you can to give people an out, such as-if you’ve run into or but heads with an enemy faction-such as the Legion feel free to rough them up-but give them a chance to escape. This doesn’t mean you need to play it like a hugbox or let people walk over you-if you warned someone multiple times to not do something and they continue or they don’t take an out you provide them, kick their teeth in.</p>
	<h1>Sergeant First Class(SFC)</h1>
	<p>You’re the Sergeant First Class, you’ve seen a lot in your career in the NCRA. The Army has been good to you, and now you need to be good to your men. While the Lieutenant might be the one with all the ideas, it is up to you to ensure that what they ask gets done.</p>
	<h2>Duties of the Sergeant First Class</h2>
	<h3>Enlisted Liaison</h3>
	<p>As the Sergeant First Class, you represent all the other enlisted men on base as well. You need to be able to bring up any concerns or problems they have to the Lieutenant, if you can’t solve them yourself. You also need to be able to pass down the Lieutenant’s orders as well. You’re the chain that links the officers and the enlisted, and don’t really reside in either category as a result. You’re here to ground the Lieutenant in reality and make sure that their goals stay realistic and possible with the men at your disposal. At the same time, you’re here to pass down the Lieutenant’s orders and ensure that the men follow them, even if they aren’t happy about it.</p>
	<h3>Advisor</h3>
	<p>Out of everyone on Camp Miller, you most likely have the most amount of experience, maybe even more than the Lieutenant. As such it is your job to use your knowledge to help advise the Lieutenant, using your experience. Ultimately it is up to the Lieutenant if they want to take your advice-you’re still below him or her in the chain of command after all.</p>
	<h3>Teacher</h3>
	<p>Due to your years of experience in the Army it is up to you to teach the enlisted as well. Namely the Sergeants, if the Sergeants are struggling, it is up to you to teach them, whether it be teaching about tactics, or about how to lead others-they’ll look to you for that advice. You can also delegate this role to your NCOs as well, depending on the concept, which is also a good way to test the knowledge of your NCOs.</p>
	<h3>Administrative Duties</h3>
	<p>As the Sergeant First Class, you can not hand out demotions, promotions, or awards.&nbsp;However you are still clear to issue any NJPs if you deem it necessary. You should also be working with your Sergeants to find people that may be deserving of a promotion or an award, and pass that information along to the Lieutenant. This can be done by writing out lengthy reports either in the IC-Discord, or by speaking to a LT in game and outlining why you think they are deserving of a promotion, punishment, award, etc.</p>
	<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
	<h3>Organizing the Men</h3>
	<p>It is best to split all army personnel on duty into two squads, one “Base” squad and one “Away” squad. Make sure that the NCOs are split evenly between the two squads(One Sergeant and Corporal to a squad). Make sure to only place one Specialist per squad as well-making each one more specialized.</p>

	<p>6-General Foodstuffs</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best to grow some razorgrain and other foods, allow someone to act as a cook and let them grow what they need to produce meals, good task to give to someone from the base team or to give to a member of Rear Echelon.</p>
	<h3>The Chain of Command</h3>
	<p>A military operates off a clear understanding of the Chain of Command, to put it simply the chain of command is the process by which orders are passed down and the hierarchy that dictates who takes orders from who. As the SFC you operate in an odd part of the chain of command, you’re an advisor. You do not lead men directly, but rather use your experience to advise those below you and above you. If all possible you should not be personally leading squads, but rather helping the squad leaders.</p>
	<h3>Working with the Men</h3>
	<p>As stated above, you’re much more of an advisory position. It is best to float between the squads, unless directed otherwise by the Lieutenant. While floating between the squads, see if they need anything in particular, as well as keep an eye on the leadership to see if they need any directing or encouragement. You may also be asked to go to a squad by the Lieutenant, to help them complete their objective-if that is the case, when you arrive it may be best to take control of the squad, depending on the situation. If you do end up taking control of the squad, only do so for a limited amount of time, and find time to speak to the squad leader afterwards, tell them where they went wrong and work with them to make sure you don’t need to come over and help them again.</p>
	<h4>Rangers</h4>
	<p>The Rangers exist outside of the NCRA command structure, and for our purposes are a separate branch of the NCR’s military. You are allowed and encouraged to work with them, just keep in mind if they have more pressing matters they may choose to disregard your requests. If possible, find ways to try and work with the Rangers, whether that be you supporting them by sending a squad to support whatever they are doing, or them supporting you by sending a group of Rangers to support what the Army is doing.</p>

	<h1>Medical Officer</h1>
	<p>You’ve been sent to Miller to stitch the infantrymen back together. You’re one of the few people who know how to set bones back in place, or treat a gunshot wound. As much as the infantry might hate to admit, they need you.</p>
	<h2>Duties of a Medical Officer</h2>
	<h3>Medical Authority</h3>
	<p>You hold the final say on the condition of the men at Camp Miller. If you believe that the men are not in a condition to be fighting, it is up to you to tell the Lieutenant and First Sergeant. You are also allowed to override the orders of the other NCOs or Officers, on the basis of medical well being. This does not allow you to override orders willy-nilly, only orders that could result in a mass casualty due to the current state of the men. For example, if half of the men at Camp Miller are suffering from a disease, and many others are also walking wounded-you could feasibly override the Lieutenant’s orders to assault the local raider gang. You also have the most medical knowledge out of everyone at Camp Miller, you’re allowed to inquire about their condition, including mental evaluations, physicals, as well as teaching the men basic first aid(as long as you have permission from the current CO) Finally, you have a single subordinate, the Combat Medic. They report to in terms of medical matters, and are your assistant when they are on base. While they are off base it may be smart to check in with them from time to time to see how their squad is doing medically. Corpsmen, from the Rear Echelon job also fall under your command as well, they’ll be attached to the base and should be helping you in the medbay, also make sure to use your knowledge to help teach them how to be competent medics.</p>
	<h3>Strictly a Non-Combatant</h3>
	<p>As the MO you are not allowed to participate in combat, as in you can not leave the Camp to go participate in a base raid or patrol. You are however allowed to act in defense of the Camp, if it were to fall under attack.</p>
	<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
	<h3>Setting Up</h3>
	<p>It is important at the start of the shift to create enough medical supplies to last you the week. To start, it would be best to print five large beakers from the Workshop, two will be used to upgrade the dispenser, the rest will be used for mixing and using. Afterwards it is best to break apart and put the distillery back together, this is to get maximum charge out of battery within the distillery. Also speak to the Rangers or the patrol squad, and try to get a cell charger as soon as possible so&nbsp;when they run out, you can take the machine apart and recharge the battery. Listed below is the order of priority for what medical items you should make first. The top three are priority and should be able to all be made without a charger. Once you get a charger, try to have thirty of everything. Also, make sure to get bone gel and surgical tape, these can not be made on base, ask either the patrol squad or rangers to pick some up for you.</p>
	<p>1-Synthflesh(30u)-20 Patches</p>
	<p>2-Mannitol-20 pills</p>
	<p>3-Saline & Iron-15 Iron Pills, 5 Vials of Saline</p>
	<p>4-Corazone</p>
	<p>5-Occuline</p>
	<p>6-Styptic Powder</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can be used by infantry to craft healing items</p>
	<p>7-Silver Sulf</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can be used by infantry to craft healing items</p>
	<h3>Order of Triage</h3>
	<p>The Order of Triage, is a tier list-by which who has the most priority when treating people. You want to start with those at the top of the list, and work your way down.</p>
	<p>1-The nearly dead, these are people in Crit.</p>
	<p>2-The dead, these are people that have flatlined and can be brought back with defibs</p>
	<p>3-The lightly wounded/walking wounded</p>
	<p>4-Those with complex injuries but are not life threatening.</p>
	<h1>Sergeant</h1>
	<p>You’re the backbone of the NCRA, the Sergeant. It's up to you that the orders of the Lieutenant and Sergeant First Class are completed, and that at the end of the week your boys are still alive. You’ve seen a lot, maybe not as much as the SFC, but still enough to know how things work around here.</p>
	<h2>Duties of a Sergeant</h2>
	<h3>Squad Leader</h3>
	<p>As a Sergeant, you are expected to lead a squad of men that will report directly to you. It is up to you to lead them for the duration of the week. In its simplest form, you’ll take orders given to you by the LT or SFC and turn them into tangible results. You may be directed to take a position, it is up to you to make sure that it gets done. You’re responsible for maneuvering your men, and ensuring your objectives are completed. &nbsp;</p>
	<h3>Enforcer</h3>
	<p>As the Sergeant, you are expected to enforce the orders of the LT and SFC, while you may have a close bond with your men, you still need to enforce the rules set in place by the LT and SFC. If the SFC says that everyone is to get a flashlight, it is up to you to check that everyone in your squad has followed that order.</p>
	<h3>Teacher</h3>
	<p>As a Sergeant, you have a good bit of experience. You’ve been through a lot, and know a thing or two. When you have the time, make sure to be teaching your men how to improve, and perhaps one day surpass you. Whether it be something as simple as setting up defenses, to as complex as leading a unit of their own, you are the one who needs to pass that knowledge along.</p>
	<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
	<h3>Setting Up</h3>
	<p>Once you’ve arrived at Camp, make sure to call out over the radio that you have arrived and ask who the current CO is. Ask for a team assignment after that, if you’ve come late, you’ll most likely be taking over from someone else, so it’d be good to get a run down of what has occurred so far from them. Once you do have your squad, it may be a good idea to give them a custom frequency to talk on-this would require you to change the wasteland radio freq to something else-so it may be a good idea for you to go grab a spare radio that you can use to listen in on that freq and talk over it if need be. It would also be smart to get your team a set of colored armbands that all of you wear-so it is easy to identify each other.</p>
	<h3>Chain of Command</h3>
	<p>As a Sergeant, it is important to have a clear understanding of the chain of command, how it works, and how you and your men fit into it. As the Sergeant &nbsp;you will be interacting with the command staff(LT and SFC) directly, so it is best to get to know them. You’ll also be acting with your squad closely as well-best to get to know them very well as well. You are also clear to issue NJPs, to people that are assigned to you, those outside of your squad you can not issue a NJP to.</p>
	<h4>Working with Command Staff</h4>
	<p>Working with command staff will be a common occurrence, it is best to be receptive to what they are asking, and to be courteous to them. You’ll often be taking orders straight from one of them, the orders of the Lieutenant do however, take precedence over the SFC. You are also their direct link to that squad, you are that squad’s mouthpiece. It is up to you to voice complaints that the squad has, as well as speak to them about the performance of the men. If you see someone you think is worth promoting, tell the LT and SFC. If you had to punish someone, tell the LT and SFC.</p>
	<h4>Working with your Squad</h4>
	<p>When you’re acting as a Sergeant, you’re always working with your squad, and your main responsibility throughout the week. It is important to get to know those under your command, see what their likes and dislikes are. You also have the final say within your squad, if you want them to do something-they ultimately have to follow it.</p>
	<h1>Corporal</h1>
	<p>You might have been in the Army for a bit, but you’re back to square one, you’re the most junior NCO on base, hell, the Privates might try to give you shit, if you let them. But remember, you’re a NCO and they aren’t. You’re here to learn all you can from the veterans on base, the SFC, and the Sergeant to name a few and hopefully not let the small amount of power you have go to your head.</p>
	<h2>Duties of a Corporal</h2>
	<h3>Teamleader</h3>
	<p>You’re still a NCO, and while you are given a bit of power, most of that is left to leading small teams, which are a part of your squad. You may be asked to take two or three men from your squad to perform a small task, such as clearing a set of rooms, or melting down cars, away from the sight of the squad leader.</p>
	<h3>Learner</h3>
	<p>As a Corporal, you’re the most junior NCO on base, and by extension have the least experience. It is up to you to learn as much as possible from the other NCOs on base. This is to prepare to one day take the helm of your own squad as a Sergeant. Learn as much as you can during the week, eventually, if you show enough competence you might be promoted to the rank of Sergeant.</p>
	<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
	<h3>Setting up</h3>
	<p>Once you come on duty, call out over the radio and state that you’re on duty and ask for a squad assignment. Once given an assignment, report into your squad. There is a chance that you may be taking over for a Spec or Trooper. If that is the case, get a run down from what has occurred so far from whoever was leading the squad before you. As well as make sure that the squad has a set of armbands to denote their squad, it may also be a good idea to move the squad onto a separate freq other than wasteland freq, if you choose to do this, get a spare radio for yourself so you can still listen in to the wasteland freq.</p>
	<h3>Chain of Command</h3>
	<p>The chain of command, in its simplest form is the hierarchy at which orders are passed down, and requests are passed up. You exist near the bottom of the chain of command. While you are still a NCO, the most you’ll be leading is a team, and sometimes a squad if there are not enough Sergeants. You are not clear to issue NJPs on your own, you’ll need to get permission from someone above you(usually your Sergeant), the only exception to this is if you’re the highest ranking member on base.</p>
	<h4>Working with the Sergeant</h4>
	<p>The person you’ll be working with the closest is the Sergeant. You are their second in command, and they rely on you to help them run the squad. This may come in the form of helping teach the squad, discipline someone or lead a small part of the squad as a separate team. Just be sure to respond to the Sergeant’s orders quickly and you should be fine.</p>
	<h1>Combat Engineer</h1>
	<p>The NCRA’s&nbsp;chief builder, you build their defenses, set up FOBs, and expand Camp Miller. You’re also the only one who knows how to work a wrench.</p>
	<h2>Duties of a Combat Engineer</h2>
	<h3>Engineer</h3>
	<p>You are tasked with building all of the NCRA’s&nbsp;defense, as well as upkeeping them. Most of the time you’ll have power over the design of how these defenses are being set up. Feel free to enlist the help of a few Troopers or rear echelon troopers to help you put things into place, or handle bigger projects.</p>
	<h3>Rifleman</h3>
	<p>While you are the combat engineer you also have a duty as a rifleman, you should not be spending all your time inside Camp, cloistered and working on defenses. You still carry the duties of a normal Trooper as well, this includes things like going on patrol, training and attending briefings.</p>
	<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
	<h3>Setting up</h3>
	<p>Upon coming on duty, sign in over the radio and ask for a squad assignment. Once given a squad, report into them and either ask for orders, if defenses have already been set up, or inform your squad leader that you are working on base defenses.</p>
	<h4>Base Defenses</h4>
	<p>&nbsp;Setting up defenses can come in many different forms, and for the most part comes down to personal preference, as long as they make a few key modifications to the base.</p>
	<h5>Checkpoint</h5>
	<p>It is important to expand the checkpoint at Camp Miller, while nice, it requires someone to be at the gate at all times, by creating a checkpoint you can create airlocks which allow people with a NCR dog tag to come and go as they please. Pictured below is an average checkpoint set up.</p>

	<p>This basic setup gets the job done. You have two lines of tables, one to place sandbags onto, and another to ensure that people can not easily climb onto your sandbags. It gives those in the checkpoint enough room to move around in. A few players like to switch out the northern door, having a wall in the middle, and two doors on the sides, to allow for more traffic. Some players also put metal bars on the outer table layer, to prevent people from being able to climb onto the tables at all.</p>
	<p>It is also best to wall off the fence to the west of Camp Miller, pictured below is the area. Only do it if you have a large surplus of materials.</p>

	<h3>Chain of Command</h3>
	<p>You do not hold a leadership role, but rather act within a squad. You report to a Sergeant and a Corporal, and are to heed their orders. As such you can not give orders, usually, this rule is oftentimes bended if there are no NCOs on base to lead the troops, in which case you may be asked to do so.</p>
	<p>Combat Medic</p>
	<p>You’re the platoon’s combat medic, unlike that prissy MO you get your hands dirty in the field. It's up to you to get the men fixed up in the heat of battle, even if they don’t think they need your help.</p>
	<h2>Duties of a Combat Medic</h2>
	<h3>Medical Authority</h3>
	<p>You hold absolute medical authority in the field, unless a MO is present. While in the field, you have the final say on the health of the men, if the unit needs to hold to heal up, you’re allowed to overrule the orders of the squad leader to ensure that the men are treated. You are not to do this willy-nilly or use it to override every order someone in the field gives, you are expected to use this to prevent a mass casualty situation, in other words, if the squad leader tell his entire squad of wounded to rush a deathclaw cave, it might be smart to overrule that and get them healed up first. &nbsp;</p>
	<h3>Medical Subordinate</h3>
	<p>You do not only report to your squad leader, but also the base’s MO. You are expected to help them with the wounded that find their way into Camp Miller, as well as help administer minor procedures such as surgeries, physicals, or resuscitations. You may also need to give medical reports back to the MO if they ask for them while you are in the field.</p>
	<h3>Rifleman</h3>
	<p>While you are the combat medic you also have a duty as a rifleman, you should not be spending all your time inside Camp, cloistered and working in the medbay. You still carry the duties of a normal Trooper as well, this includes things like going on patrol, training and attending briefings.</p>
	<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
	<h3>Setting Up</h3>
	<p>Once you wake up, report over the radio and ask for a squad assignment. Once you have been given a squad, check to ensure that the Camp has enough medical supplies to last them a week. It is important at the start of the shift to create enough medical supplies to last you the week. To start, it would be best to print five large beakers from the Workshop, two will be used to upgrade the dispenser, the rest will be used for mixing and using. Afterwards it is best to break apart and put the distillery back together, this is to get maximum charge out of battery within the distillery. Also speak to the Rangers or the patrol squad, and try to get a cell charger as soon as possible so&nbsp;when they run out, you can take the machine apart and recharge the battery. Listed below is the order of priority for what medical items you should make first. The top three are priority and should be able to all be made without a charger. Once you get a charger, try to have thirty of everything. Also, make sure to get bone gel and surgical tape, these can not be made on base, ask either the patrol squad or rangers to pick some up for you.</p>

	<p>7-Silver Sulf</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can be used by infantry to craft healing items</p>
	<h3>Order of Triage</h3>
	<p>The Order of Triage, is a tier list-by which who has the most priority when treating people. You want to start with those at the top of the list, and work your way down.</p>
	<p>1-The nearly dead, these are people in Crit.</p>
	<p>2-The dead, these are people that have flatlined and can be brought back with defibs</p>
	<p>3-The lightly wounded/walking wounded</p>
	<p>4-Those with complex injuries but are not life threatening.</p>
	<h1>NCR Trooper</h1>
	<p>Welcome to the Army! You (hopefully) still have a long career ahead of you, for now however, you’re just listening to a few assholes above you. Do as they say and you should make it out alive.</p>
	<h2>Duties of a Trooper</h2>
	<p>You’re the lowest in the chain of command. Your only job is to listen to those above you, and try not to die. Follow the chain of command, and do what your squad leader tells you to do. It is also a good time to begin thinking about what you plan to do in the Army. &nbsp;</p>
	<h3>Rifleman</h3>
	<p>At the end of the day, your true purpose here is to act as a rifleman. You make up the bulk of the army and it is your job to follow through the orders of your squad leader. You’re at the bottom of the chain of command, however that does not mean you take orders from anyone. You only take orders from your squad leader, along with the SFC and LT. You do not have to follow the orders of someone from another squad, unless it is an emergency.</p>
	<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
	<h3>Setting up</h3>
	<p>Once you come on duty, sign in over the radio and ask for a squad assignment. Report into your squad leader and ask for tasking from there, try not to die. It is also smart to grab a few extra mags of ammo from the armory as well, and check to see if there are any better weapons available, double check before taking any of them, but if you’re clear to, help yourself. Make sure to grab extra medical supplies as well, namely stimpaks and bandages.</p>
	<h1>NCR Rear Echelon</h1>
	<p>Welcome to the Army! You’ve enlisted and been placed into your unit’s rear echelon unit. While you don’t participate in combat, you’re here to assist the troops while they are on base, and hopefully learn more about what you want to do in the Army, if you plan to go into active service.</p>
	<h2>Duties of Rear Echelon</h2>
	<h2>Non-Combatant</h2>
	<p>As Rear Echelon you are not allowed to participate in combat, as in you can not leave the Camp to go participate in a base raid or patrol. You are however allowed to act in defense of the Camp, if it were to fall under attack.</p>
	<h3>Learner</h3>
	<p>While spending your time in Rear Echelon, it is important to try and learn as much as possible, before you move up to Trooper. This is a good chance to begin learning about the various parts that make up Camp Miller and see what interests you. It is also important to learn as much as possible about Camp protocol and how the army likes to operate, if you’re unsure about something, be sure to ask a question!</p>
	<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
	<p>When you come on duty, sign in over the radio and ask for an assignment. Unlike the rest of the Army you will most likely not be placed into a squad permanently, but rather rolling with whatever squad is on base, helping one of the Leadership roles, or working with the MOs. Wherever you do end up being sent, make sure to ask plenty of questions and learn as much as you can.</p>
