	- If someone sends you a message and you reject them please remember not to be overly cruel ICly.\n\
	Unless they're into that, and its part of a bit. \n\
	- With understanding that rejection is sometimes a part of flirting, the 3. Option exists, use it specifically to play 'hard to get'. \n\
	\n\
	-- There are different categories of flirt. These exist to help the flirter figure out what approach they're using. \n\
	- Leer is generally you looking at them in some way. \n\
	-- React is generally you having some sort of reaction to them, like making a noise or a reflexive physical reactions like biting your own lower lip. \n\
	--- Touch is generally you attempting to touch them in some manner, like coping a feel or brushing a cheek. \n\
	\n\
	-- So lets try to hold onto your charm, shall we?\n\
