// Metal- Melee, Laser Good, Ballistics Moderate, Energy, Explosion bad
// Leather/soft armor: Melee Good, Laser , Energy, Explosion Moderate, Ballistic Bad
// Coat style armor is good for allround protection but excels at none. (note plated with unarmored duster over is still plated.)
// Kevlar: Ballistic Good, all others Bad.
// Mix can vary wildly but usually has some glaring strongpoints and weakspots.
// Combat armor is allround but not top defense against any single category.
// Thick warm armor gives cold protection, piecemeal gives overheating protection.
// Armor covering much of the body gives more defense vs acid, fire, bio in general and vice versa.

Though only upon closer examination can the intricacies of the armor set be observed. The most obvious piece is the metal vest which has clearly been engraved, mostly decorationally besides the name 'Iudex Flammae' near the top. Though the engravings provide no tactical advantage whatsoever, the sharp geometric shapes accompanied by smooth, tastefully placed curves would catch the eye of even the most skeptical engraving enjoyer. As for the shoulder pad and arm guards, they hold the same engravings, and though they are recognizable as salvage, they still look incredibly beautiful yet simultaneously sturdy. Not much of the metal seems to exist on the back though that is only due to the fact that the incredibly thick, durable and flexible bear pelt that covers it would definitely provide ample protection. The pelt itself is absolutely covered in thick, almost jet black fur. One can tell from touch that the skin underneath is about as sturdy as skin gets. The pelt hangs across the wearer's back, held up by the neck and shoulders. This armor was competently made, and it shows."
