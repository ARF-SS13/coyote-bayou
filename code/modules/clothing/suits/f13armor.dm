Upon basic examination, one can see that every piece of metal bar the buckles on the leather straps and whatever scratches and blemishes are yet to be retouched is masterfully decorated with silver, in complete contrast to the blackness of the cloak. Though only upon closer examination can the intricacies of the armor set be observed. The most obvious piece is the metal vest which has clearly been engraved, mostly decorationally besides the name 'Iudex Flammae' near the top. Though the engravings provide no tactical advantage whatsoever, the sharp geometric shapes accompanied by smooth, tastefully placed curves would catch the eye of even the most skeptical engraving enjoyer. As for the shoulder pad and arm guards, they hold the same engravings, and though they are recognizable as salvage, they still look incredibly beautiful yet simultaneously sturdy. Not much of the metal seems to exist on the back though that is only due to the fact that the incredibly thick, durable and flexible bear pelt that covers it would definitely provide ample protection. The pelt itself is absolutely covered in thick, almost jet black fur. One can tell from touch that the skin underneath is about as sturdy as skin gets. The pelt hangs across the wearer's back, held up by the neck and shoulders. This armor was competently made, and it shows."
