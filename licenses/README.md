# Licensing

This section is to credit where external assets were sourced from with appropriate licensing.

## Formatting

Ensure that the license of the codebase you're using has the correct type which we can properly use.
For CC by SA v3, we have to link to the license, then provide a link to the source, and name it.

If it's under the AGPL/GPL license, we also should credit them.
