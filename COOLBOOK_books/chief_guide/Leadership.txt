1. Be humble
- Chiefs who are humble share the success of the tribe with other members. You might do this by drawing attention to the hard work of each individual and 
recognizing the effort of any against external forces when they have the chance to do so. This type of humility can help all of the tribe and build a sense of
bonding and pride in the actions of those you care for. 

A chief who lacks humility will be seen as overbearing.



2. Hunt if you are to hunt
- Rather than focusing on any given problem, effective chiefs direct their attention toward the solution. They may do this by focusing on the tribes goals and
developing a plan to meet those goals. Effective chiefs prioritize so they can complete the most urgent tasks first.

- Be decisive in what you do.  Make your choices as swiftly as you can and move towards them with rapidity.  The momentum of a chief unleashed can drive the entire
tribe into a fervor that can solve innumerable issues.

A chief who does not cast the spear of decision into the herd of problems at a specific target will miss every time.



3. Build trust
- Develop bonds between the members of the tribe that can help them all work together better.  Be considerate to each members needs when you can, and straight forward
with them when you can not.  Learn about those below you so that they know you care, learn what they fear and love, learn so that when the time comes you are ready to
help them with your knowledge.  Join them in activities, be fair and consitent, involve all that you can and recognize the shared workload of the tribe.

- Encourage communication between all levels of the tribe, make sure that all levels feel heard and encourage their feedback.

A chief who does not build trust with those around him will have a dagger at his back in every dark corner.

4. Be the example
- All look to you for leadership.  Make sure that what they see and seek to emulate is something that should be copied.

5. Know when to delegate tasks
- You are but one soul chief.  Remember that at all times.  Use the shamans, druids, and Hunt Master to ease your workload.  Do not lose sight of the forest for the trees.

6. Know your limits
- Know when it is time to step back and approach a problem in a different way.  While there are times that doubling down is the right choice for a hunt, there are also
times that attacking the aethergiest with your bare fists is foolishness.  Do not be blinded to it when the time comes.

7. Learn from your mistakes
- No chief is perfect, we are all human after all.  Look at what humanity has already wrought to this land and remember that you are perhaps entirely capable of the same.
Instead, have the space to step back from a mistake and realize what it is.  Take it in and learn from it.

When the darkness comes.
When the torches sputter out.
Lead with wisdom, chief.
