		"",

		"Just tested, webps dont work. So, yeah, PNG, JPG, and GIF.",
		"",
		"- The image must be under 150kb in size. This is so players with slower internet connections arent <i>totally</i> wrecked by the download.",
		"Do note that this runs on the honor system (that a dev will check when you PR, so... sorta-honor system), cus I'm too much of a noob to figure out how to do that lol",
		"",
		"- You should be okay with the image getting stretched to fit into a roughly 400x150 pixel width and height space.",
		"",
		"- While explicit images <i>are</i> allowed, please be reasonable with them. Try to keep them in specifically marked NSFW chapters/books.",
		"",
		"- Images hosted on Discord may, at some point, cease to work. If this happens, just reupload the image and update the URL in a PR.",
		"",
		"- After PRing your book, you can ask a headcooder to upload your images to TGS, to make them a lot more reliable. Though, try to give your book a week or so before asking.",

		"- And above all, <i>have fun!</i>",
		"",
