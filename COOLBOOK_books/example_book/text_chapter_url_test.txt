Hi! All the images in this chapter are pulled from URLs!
This will be how you, as a bookmaker, put images in the books you make.

Most images are hosted on the server and injected in via TGS, but you'd need to be a webmaster to do <i>that</i>,
since it involves needing access to the server console thing. And while you technically <i>could</i> PR your images
and have them hosted on the server's repo, its not always the best idea to do so. For example, if you're making a
book with a bunch of <i>risque</i> images (or just images you kinda sorta don't have the rights to (naughty naughty)),
you probably don't want them on the server's repo. Could get us (and then you!) in trouble! So, to get around this (sorta),
you can host your images on Discord and pull them in from there!

To do this, you'll need to upload your images to Discord, and then right click on them and select \"Copy Link\". This will
give you a URL that you can use to pull the image into your book. You can then use the URL in the chapter's metadata like you
see above. The format is similar to the typical TXT chapter image format, but with the addition of tag 'URL', and the URL itself.
The tag 'URL' is used to tell the COOLBOOK system that the image is a URL, and to try downloading it into the server's cache.
That's it! 

--PAGEBREAK--

A few things to note:
- The URL must be a direct, valid link to the image. If you're using Discord, you can get this by right clicking on the image and selecting \"Copy Link\".

- The URL must be either a PNG, a JPG, or a GIF. While I'm like 90% sure other formats would work, I haven't tested them and don't exactly trust them to work.
just tested, webp doesnt work. so yeah, only PNG, JPG, and GIF.

- The image must be under 150kb in size. This is so players with slower internet connections arent <i>totally</i> wrecked by the download.
Do note that this runs on the honor system (that a dev will check when you PR, so... sorta-honor system), cus I'm too much of a noob to figure out how to do that lol

- You should be okay with the image getting stretched to fit into a roughly 400x150 pixel width and height space.

- While explicit images <i>are</i> allowed, please be reasonable with them. Try to keep them in specifically marked NSFW chapters/books.

- Images hosted on Discord may, at some point, cease to work. If this happens, just reupload the image and update the URL in a PR.

- After PRing your book, you can ask a headcooder to upload your images to TGS, to make them a lot more reliable. Though, try to give your book a week or so before asking.

- And above all, <i>have fun!</i>
