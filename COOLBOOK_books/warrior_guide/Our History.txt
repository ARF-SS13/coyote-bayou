Historically our histories are kept verbally, passed down from Shaman to any who would sit to listen to them.  Usually other shamans, or shamans-to-be. This section exists 
to finally have a record of what we can assume is correct.  These pages are broken down by time period, the list of which follows.

- Before the Breaking
- The Damned
- Homecoming
- Return To Nature
- Growth
- To Expand
- The Fall

- Before the Breaking

We may not remember, but the spirits have made it clear that our kind existed long before the fall of the old world.  There were always those that retained a closeness
to the spirit realm, even if they didn't know what it was that they were doing.  We know that the world was overgrown by mankind and that their hatred, fear, and desire
to expand were unchecked.

The spirits sing of this time in much the same way that a brahmin would call for a lost calf.  They know that the hand that drove the world to the madness that came
was out of their control, and they weep for those that suffered under the lash of what came.  

When the sun touched the ground and the ash on the wind choked our lungs we knew fear.  We knew death and we knew what it meant to not know if waking would come to loved
ones dead, children carried off by monsters, or even to wake at all. 


--PAGEBREAK--

- The Damned

It is said that the ancestors of the tribe who escaped from the hellfires and madness wandered into the Sulphur Bottom swamplands. For reference these are the swamps to
the South, and West of our old village.  They continue on for some time, but our family got lost in them.  They starved, but the swamp had not twisted yet.  They suffered,
but not because the very universe was unraveling before them.

It is unknown how long we bared our burden through the swamplands like so many leaves in the wind.  It is known that some came, and some went from the group, that death and
starvation was the normal way of things and that the tears that were wept would eventually lead us home.  

Eventually it is said that our kin found a mother and father spirit residing in a cave beyond the ruins of the city we know as Mt. Pleasant. The spirits taught our unlearned
kin how to survive, and how to thrive.

--PAGEBREAK--

- Homecoming

The spirits taught us to farm, to build, and to dress ourselves again.  The spirits showed us which plants were safe, which were not.  Which bones to use for tools, and
which ways to stalk in the moistness of the night.

Never was a name given to the mother and father spirits, for they left us before a great blight.  What is known is that once our home village had finally gained some sembalance
of stability then the winds of horror finally seeped into the swamplands about us.  We gathered what we could, what animals and creatures that we could, and under stormy green skies took refuge.

Within the cave that the spirits had been found our tribe buried itself, to survive the dark nights to come.  No memory exists for how long we stayed below, and the spirits
do not ever give the same answer twice, but it was here that we learned communion with them in truth.  It was here that the first shaman discovered their scrying orb, that the first druid
touched grass and knew it healthy without a thought, and that the first true Sulphur Bottom child was born.

Eventually, that time of solitude ended.  The storm passed, and our people pulled themselves out into a now twisted swampland, ready to face it in ways their own ancestors would have never
been able.

- Return To Nature

The climb out of the long darkness was not perilous, but the surface was.  This was the first time our people saw the monsters that roam this land.  Geckos, bloatflies,
hellpigs, aethergiests.  None of these monsters had ever creeped into the Bottoms lands before the storm and were considered rumors by many of our people.

A few hunters knew otherwise, having been welcomed in as refugees themselves before the sealing of the cave they taught how to fight these new creatures and showed us all how
to engage them successfully. We conquered the land around us in a way that we never had before, the Hunt Master and Guardian concepts grew into being as the village became a town.
Then a city.  

Fired clay on unstable earth, gecko meat over a humid campsite.  These days were full of growth.

- Growth

Slowly the tribe took in more and more refugees.  The nearby town of Mt. Pleasant had, like most of the rest of the world, been hit hard. Survivors trickled in and we
did as the spirits said.  To care for wounds, help them bare children, build them homes and teach them our ways.  Some did not stay long, hoping to find loved ones 
almost certainly lost in the breaking or to return to homes now rendered unto ash.

Grow we did, from a small tribe into a people. Eventually the home settlement of Pleasant Creek became too large though.  The spirits were asked, and the answer was simple.
Make more settlements.

--PAGEBREAK--

- To Expand

We do not know how long the tribe expanded, but the process was not overly difficult.  Hunters would go ahead of villagers and builders.  Set up the domain and safe the ground.
A chief would be picked from amongst them, and their own shamans, druids, and other members would either travel by urging from spirits or be born and lifted upon their own.

Long ago now, it is unsure how many moons, our people came to the swamps south of what remains of Texarkana.  The spirits sang that it was good, that we had to hold on and survive.
So we did.  Then came the winterhell, and the fall of our old camp.

--PAGEBREAK--

- The Fall

When the winter came runners from the south came with it.  Harried hunters, distraught villages on foot unattended.  It is still unclear what happened but we lost contact with our tribe.
Eventually our runners stopped returning from the south.  The few that did spoke of horrible twisted creatures that none had ever seen before. Of abominations and trees bleeding like wounded
animals.

On the winter solstice a few years ago the moon turned red, and the howls of the night became obvious that the creatures had arrived.  Our warriors thought more time would be had to defend the camp
but they were sadly wrong.  The warriors ralied as best they could, and the people of the tribe fled north into the swamplands around Redwater.  In our haste we headed to the only place
that happened to have a wall, the township of Nash.  

They showed us kindness, and opened the doors to allow us in freely that night.  Their doctors helped our shamans to tend wounds, and our builders were given permission to put up a place for us to live.
The tribe suffered in this time, its people scattered, and any knowledge further south than our old camp is lost to us largely.

--PAGEBREAK--

- Today

The tribe stirs, our people are starting to come back together.  Occasionally a lost lamb wanders in from the south, and while the reports say it remains hellish, and our spirit orbs do not allow us
to see that far, there remains hope.  This section is short, because to be blunt with you dear reader it is still being written.  By you.  Right now.

Please try to leave a good impression on the next person who writes these histories, and remember peace dear tribekin.
