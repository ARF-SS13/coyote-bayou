We recognize that the pages ahead will be heavily dependent on the type of hunter that you feel you are and that not all use all the tools available.  You as a member
of the pack must realize that not all prey can be defeated with every instrument.  Some tools, much like any other profession, are far more effective than others.

Generic waste Threats

- Gecko

There are many kinds of geckos, but the creature is at its core simply not brave.  Learn to be brave in its face and slap down the members of its kind that still insist
on doing battle.  

- Molerat

The trick to fighting molerats is to limit how many can approach you at any given time.  Find a tight place and squeeze into it.  Limit how many can bite and their gnashing
fangs count for much less.


- Ghouls

The feral monsters of the age past are of little difficulty, use sightlines to break vision with the ones that can throw things at you and otherwise fight them much
like you would molerats and one shouldn't have many issues.

- Mirelurks

The watercrabs of the swamps are perhaps some of the most brainless animals around.  While the adults can be aggressive they are not hard to dispatch as long as you stay on your 
toes.  

- Radscorpions

This may be the first time you hear this but the larger insects of the land are very short sighted.  Consider not engaging unless you have a shield or can keep range, but 
know that their vision is very short (about 20 feet or so) and that if you can stay quiet and a bit back from them you can maneuver around them quite easily.

- Ants & Fireants

Containing many of the same weaknesses as their radscorpion cousins the large mutated ants are just as short sighted.  Their saving grace for fighting back is that the
red ant variety can set you on fire. Be careful not to panic as killing the creature should come first.  No matter how much it hurts.

- Nightstalkers

While hardly a holy animal the adults can be quite hard to deal with in large numbers. Thankfully that doesn't happen often, but if you find yourself in such a situation your best
bet is to wedge in like you would with molerats and face the foes one at a time.  The young though, it should be noted, are of no threat unless cornered.  Save your strength unless
their death serves a purpose.

- Cazadores

These flying monsters are known for making wretched messes of unprepared hunters.  If you know beforehand you will be facing them most hunters suggest bringing a shield to
help catch their stinger before it can pierce you and cause confusion.  Alternatively thrown items seem very effective.  Slings and sling staffs are an option, but a bit slow.
While bows tend to be even better.

Larger Threats

- Hellpigs

These mutated boars are simple at the core. They charge, try to get you caught on trees or other tight spaces, and attempt to gore you. A smart warrior can down one quite 
safetly with a spear as long as they can keep it at arms length.

- Deathclaws

More dangerous by far than hellpigs the aethergiest has been known to come in different variety and most of them become furious after a certain amount of blood has been
spilled from them.  Be aware they can hit so hard it throws you, and try to fight them in places where you can keep range.  Be it reach with a spear and shield or bows.
It is also suggested to fight them with 2 hunters per 1 aethergiest, as one can always be stabbing at the beast while its simple mind focuses the other hunter that evades.

- Robots

Robots vary heavily but one thing remains the same.  We can make arrows that absolutely ruin them.  Make yourself EMP Arrows if you think you will be running into them and know
that the spirits bless them.

- Raiders

Other people are always the most dangerous thing you can ever run into, be they a renegade gunner or even some redwater reject still floating around. The ones that will
speak to you should be kept at arms length at best. Do not provoke them, and disengage as soon as you can.  The ones that care not for talking should be put down as rapidly
as you can.
